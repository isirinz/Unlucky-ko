/**
 * A Move is an attack or ability that can deal damage or other effects to Entities.
 *
 * There are 4 types of moves separated into 4 categories:
 * - Accurate: close damage range with little standard deviation for most consistent damage
 * - Wide: high risk high reward type; very large damage range
 * - Crit: fixed damage but has chance for critical strike that does massive damage
 * - Healing: heals the Entity based on set range and reduces the damage of
 * the next attack by some set percentage
 *
 * In terms of maximum damage: Crit > Wide > Accurate
 * In terms of damage over time: Accurate > Wide > Crit
 * In terms of least possible damage: Wide > Crit > Accurate
